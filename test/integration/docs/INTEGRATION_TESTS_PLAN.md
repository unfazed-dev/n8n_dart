# Integration Tests Implementation Plan

## ✅ CREDENTIAL AVAILABILITY

**We Have:**
- ✅ **n8n cloud credentials** (https://kinly.app.n8n.cloud)
- ✅ **Supabase credentials** (PostgreSQL database)
- ✅ Can create and execute workflows with database operations

**We Do NOT Have:**
- ❌ Stripe API keys
- ❌ AWS S3 / Google Drive credentials
- ❌ Google Sheets API credentials
- ❌ Email service (SMTP) credentials

**Impact on Testing:**
- ✅ **Can execute 3 templates fully:** CRUD API, Multi-Step Form, Data Sync (only need PostgreSQL)
- ⚠️ **Can partially execute 4 templates:** User Registration, File Upload, Order Processing, Scheduled Report (database parts work, email/payment/storage parts skip)
- ❌ **Cannot execute 1 template:** Webhook Logger (needs Google Sheets)
- ✅ **Can test:** Core execution, polling, wait nodes, reactive features, database operations
- ✅ **Can validate:** All template JSON generation + structure

**Testing Strategy:**
- **4 simple custom test workflows** for core execution testing (connection, polling, wait nodes, errors)
- **3 templates with full execution + Supabase** (CRUD API, Multi-Step Form, Data Sync)
  - Complete end-to-end testing with database operations
  - Validates both workflow execution AND database integration
  - Tests wait nodes in Multi-Step Form with real database storage
- **4 templates with partial execution** (User Registration, File Upload, Order Processing, Scheduled Report)
  - Database operations fully tested (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)
  - External service nodes disabled (email, payment, file storage, sheets)
- **1 template with JSON validation only** (Webhook Logger - requires Google Sheets)

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of comprehensive integration tests for the n8n_dart package. While the project currently has excellent unit test coverage (422 tests, 9,256 lines) using mocks, it lacks validation against real n8n servers. Integration tests will validate production readiness, reactive stream behavior, and compatibility with actual n8n instances.

**Key Components:**
- Real n8n server testing using cloud instance (https://kinly.app.n8n.cloud)
- End-to-end workflow execution validation
- Reactive stream behavior verification under real network conditions
- Circuit breaker and error recovery testing with actual failures
- **Template validation** - Test all 8 pre-built workflow templates
- Workflow generator validation (JSON export/import)
- Documentation example verification

**Why This is Needed:**
- Package claims "production-ready" but has never been tested with real n8n
- Reactive features (circuit breaker, adaptive polling) need real-world validation
- **8 pre-built templates** have never been validated with real n8n execution
- Workflow generator (JSON export/import) needs real-world verification
- Documentation examples should be verified as working
- User confidence boost through demonstrated real-world usage
- Early detection of n8n API changes or compatibility issues

**Architecture Fit:**
Integration tests sit above unit tests in the testing pyramid, validating the entire stack from API calls through to n8n server responses. They complement (not replace) existing unit tests by providing real-world validation.

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Package users: Increased confidence in production readiness
- Package maintainers: Early warning of API compatibility issues
- Documentation users: Verified working examples

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Objective 1: Production Readiness Validation** - Verify the package works correctly with real n8n cloud servers, validating all core operations (start, poll, resume, cancel)
- **Objective 2: Reactive Features Verification** - Test circuit breaker, adaptive polling, error recovery, and stream composition under real network conditions
- **Objective 3: Template Validation** - Verify all 8 pre-built workflow templates generate valid JSON and execute correctly on n8n cloud
- **Objective 4: Workflow Generator Validation** - Test programmatic workflow creation, JSON export/import, and node connection logic
- **Objective 5: Documentation Accuracy** - Ensure all README examples and migration guide patterns work with actual n8n instances
- **Objective 6: Continuous Validation** - Establish automated integration testing in CI/CD to catch regressions and API changes early

## 🔄 Test Categories

### **Category 1: Connection & Health Checks (Essential)**
Validates basic connectivity to n8n cloud instance.

**Workflow:**
```dart
// Test n8n cloud connection
final client = N8nClient(
  config: N8nConfigProfiles.production(
    baseUrl: 'https://kinly.app.n8n.cloud',
  ),
);
final isHealthy = await client.testConnection();
expect(isHealthy, isTrue);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Verify cloud instance accessibility
- Validate connection configuration
- Test connection failure handling
- Confirm SSL/TLS certificate validation

---

### **Category 2: Workflow Execution (Critical)**
Tests complete workflow lifecycle from start to completion.

**Workflow:**
```dart
// Start workflow, poll until complete
final execution = await client.startWorkflow(webhookId, data).first;
final completed = await client.pollExecutionStatus(execution.id)
    .firstWhere((e) => e.isFinished);
expect(completed.status, WorkflowStatus.success);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Basic workflow execution (webhook trigger)
- Polling until completion with real response times
- Status updates during execution
- Execution data retrieval

---

### **Category 3: Reactive Streams (High Priority)**
Validates reactive features under real network conditions.

**Workflow:**
```dart
// Test circuit breaker with real failures
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  try { await client.startWorkflow('invalid', {}).first; } catch (_) {}
}
expect(client.errorHandler.circuitBreakerState, CircuitState.open);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Circuit breaker failure detection
- Adaptive polling interval adjustment
- Stream error recovery with retries
- Event stream filtering and composition

---

### **Category 4: Wait Nodes & Resume (Critical)**
Tests wait node workflows across all 4 modes: time interval, specified time, webhook, and form submission.

**Wait Node Modes:**

**Mode 1: Time Interval** (Automated)
```dart
// Start workflow that waits 5 seconds
final execution = await client.startWorkflow('test/wait-time', {});
// Workflow auto-completes after 5 seconds - no manual intervention needed
final completed = await waitForCompletedState(client, execution.id);
expect(completed.status, WorkflowStatus.success);
```

**Mode 2: Specified Time** (Automated)
```dart
// Start workflow that waits until specific datetime
final targetTime = DateTime.now().add(Duration(seconds: 10));
final execution = await client.startWorkflow('test/wait-until', {});
// Workflow auto-completes at specified time
```

**Mode 3: Webhook Resume** (External Trigger)
```dart
// Start workflow that waits for webhook call
final execution = await client.startWorkflow('test/wait-webhook', {});
final waiting = await waitForWaitingState(client, execution.id);
// External system calls resumeUrl to continue workflow
// SDK provides: waiting.waitNodeData?.resumeUrl
```

**Mode 4: Form Submission** (User Input)
```dart
// Start workflow with form submission wait
final execution = await client.startWorkflow('test/wait-node', {});
final waiting = await waitForWaitingState(client, execution.id);
// User fills form at: waiting.waitNodeData?.formUrl
await client.resumeWorkflow(execution.id, formData);
final completed = await waitForCompletedState(client, execution.id);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Time-based delays (rate limiting, scheduled actions)
- External system integrations (payment confirmations, API callbacks)
- Human-in-the-loop workflows (approvals, data collection)
- Wait node mode detection (`WaitMode` enum)
- Form field validation
- Workflow resumption patterns
- Multi-step workflow completion

---

### **Category 5: Advanced Patterns (Important)**
Tests complex reactive stream compositions.

**Workflow:**
```dart
// Parallel execution with combineLatest
final streams = webhookIds.map((id) =>
  client.startWorkflow(id, data)
).toList();
final results = await Rx.forkJoin(streams).first;
```

**Use Cases:**
- Parallel workflow execution
- Sequential workflow chaining
- Race condition handling
- Batch processing with queue

---

### **Category 6: Template Validation (Critical)**
Tests all 8 pre-built workflow templates.

**Workflow:**
```dart
// Generate template and validate JSON structure
final workflow = WorkflowTemplates.crudApi(
  resourceName: 'users',
  tableName: 'users',
);

// Validate JSON structure
final json = workflow.toJson();
expect(json['name'], 'USERS CRUD API');
expect(json['nodes'], hasLength(greaterThan(5)));
expect(json['connections'], isNotEmpty);

// Optional: Upload and execute on n8n cloud
// final execution = await client.uploadAndExecute(workflow);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Template JSON generation
- Template structure validation
- Template parameter handling
- (Optional) Template execution on n8n cloud

**Templates to Test:**
1. CRUD API (`WorkflowTemplates.crudApi()`)
2. User Registration (`WorkflowTemplates.userRegistration()`)
3. File Upload (`WorkflowTemplates.fileUpload()`)
4. Order Processing (`WorkflowTemplates.orderProcessing()`)
5. Multi-Step Form (`WorkflowTemplates.multiStepForm()`) - **Has wait nodes!**
6. Scheduled Report (`WorkflowTemplates.scheduledReport()`)
7. Data Sync (`WorkflowTemplates.dataSync()`)
8. Webhook Logger (`WorkflowTemplates.webhookLogger()`)

---

### **Category 7: Workflow Generator (Important)**
Tests programmatic workflow creation with WorkflowBuilder.

**Workflow:**
```dart
// Build custom workflow programmatically
final workflow = WorkflowBuilder.create()
  .name('Dynamic Test Workflow')
  .webhookTrigger(path: 'test')
  .function(code: 'return items;')
  .respondToWebhook()
  .connectSequence(['Webhook', 'Function', 'Respond'])
  .build();

// Validate and export
final json = workflow.toJson();
await workflow.saveToFile('test_workflow.json');

// Import and verify
final imported = N8nWorkflow.fromJson(File('test_workflow.json').readAsStringSync());
expect(imported.name, workflow.name);
```

**Use Cases:**
- Dynamic workflow creation
- JSON export/import
- Node connection logic
- Custom workflow templates

## 🚨 Known Limitations & Considerations

### Test Environment
- Tests depend on external n8n cloud service availability
- Network latency affects test execution time
- Rate limits may impact test throughput
- Requires active internet connection

### Workflow Management
- Test workflows must be manually created on n8n cloud
- Workflow IDs must be kept in sync with configuration
- Cleanup of old executions may be needed periodically
- Changes to workflows require test updates

### CI/CD
- Integration tests take longer than unit tests (~15-20 minutes)
- Should run on separate schedule (nightly/release) rather than every commit
- Requires secure credential management
- Test failures may indicate n8n API changes, not code issues

### General
- Integration tests complement (not replace) unit tests
- Some test scenarios may be difficult to reproduce consistently
- Test flakiness must be monitored and addressed proactively
- May require multiple n8n cloud projects for parallel testing

## 📝 Version 1.0.0 Update Summary

### Key Changes in This Version

**What Changed:**
- Added **Template Validation** as major objective (Objective 3)
- Added **Workflow Generator Validation** (Objective 4)
- Expanded test categories from 5 to 7 (added Categories 6 & 7)
- Enhanced Phase 3: "Advanced Patterns" → "Template Validation & Advanced Patterns"
- Updated test counts: 50-60 → 60-70 tests
- Updated execution time: <20 min → <25 min (includes template validation)
- Added `test/generated_workflows/` directory for exported templates
- Added `template_validation_test.dart` and `template_helpers.dart`

**Why This Matters:**
- n8n_dart has **8 pre-built workflow templates** (not just 4 test workflows)
- Templates are core library feature used by users
- Templates serve as documentation examples
- Must validate they generate valid JSON and work correctly
- Validates both **execution engine** AND **workflow generator**

**Templates Being Validated:**
1. CRUD API (`WorkflowTemplates.crudApi()`)
2. User Registration (`WorkflowTemplates.userRegistration()`)
3. File Upload (`WorkflowTemplates.fileUpload()`)
4. Order Processing (`WorkflowTemplates.orderProcessing()`)
5. Multi-Step Form (`WorkflowTemplates.multiStepForm()`) - Has wait nodes!
6. Scheduled Report (`WorkflowTemplates.scheduledReport()`)
7. Data Sync (`WorkflowTemplates.dataSync()`)
8. Webhook Logger (`WorkflowTemplates.webhookLogger()`)

**Testing Approach:**
- **Level 1 (Required):** Generate templates, validate JSON structure, export to files
- **Level 2 (Optional):** Upload to n8n cloud if API available
- No external dependencies needed for Level 1 (JSON generation only)
- Fast execution: <100ms per template

**Impact:**
- Additional effort: ~1-2 days in Phase 3
- Additional tests: +10-15 tests for template validation
- Additional execution time: +5 minutes
- High ROI: Validates major library feature with minimal complexity

**Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ All existing test plans remain valid
- ✅ Template tests are additive (don't replace anything)
- ✅ Phase 1 and 2 unchanged
- ✅ Can be implemented incrementally
